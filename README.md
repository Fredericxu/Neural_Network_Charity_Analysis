# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. To preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model, and to compile, train, and evaluate the Model, and optimize the Model for 3 times to reach a 75% target.
## Results
### Data Processing
So the NAME and EIN were removed from input and data, with the rest variables left.
- Model Configuration hidden_nodes_layer1= 80
- Model Configuration hidden_nodes_layer2= 30
- Model Configuration hidden_nodes_layer3= 43

### 3 attampts and outcome
- Increase the model confuguration hidden_nodes_layer1 for 3 times
- Increase the model configuration hidden_nodes_layer1 and 2 to layer 3
- Attampt with linear, tanh and sigmoid combination of hidden layers and output layers

It failed to reach 75% target with a rate around 65%
## Summary
Adding more layers and try different combinations may keep increase the rate of success for this model.
